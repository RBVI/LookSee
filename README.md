# LookSee
Molecular viewer for Quest VR headsets

LookSee is an application for Quest 2 and Quest Pro virtual reality headsets
to display 3-dimensional scenes of molecules and cells.  The scenes are created
in GLTF file format with the [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/)
molecular visualization program.  Installing LookSee and using the Send to Quest
tool within UCSF ChimeraX are described
[here](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/looksee-mar2023/looksee.html).
